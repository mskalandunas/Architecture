# Journey to Software Architect
This is meant to be a blueprint for growing into the software architect role.  This has been curated from a number of sources and is meant to be for personal documentation rather than as a public endeavor.  

I'm using Khalil Stemmler's _["How to Learn Software Design and Architecture | The Full-stack Software Design & Architecture Map"](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/full-stack-software-design/)_ as the building blocks for this documentation.  If you happen to be reading this README, I highly recommend you detour and read Khalil's work instead as he consistently puts out excellent content.

Ordered overview of categories:
- [Clean Code](#clean-code)
- [Programming Paradigms](#programming-paradigms)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Design Principles
- Design Patterns
- Architectural Principles
- Architectural Styles
- Archcitectural Patterns
- Enterprise Patterns

This starts simply, maybe from a newer professional's view, and gradually increases in scope.  Low level to high level.

## Clean Code
Coding basics.  Style, naming, testing.

> Code that is easy to understand and change

The definition of clean code.  Clean code manifests itself in the below subcategories. 

Subcategories:
- Consistenccy
- Self-documenting code
  - Meaningful naming
  - Thorough typing
  - Testing
- Consistent indentation and style
- Small files, functions, methods, classes
- Pure functions
- Refactor switch statements to classes
- [Work around booleans as function parameters](https://medium.com/@amlcurran/clean-code-the-curse-of-a-boolean-parameter-c237a830b7a3https://medium.com/@amlcurran/clean-code-the-curse-of-a-boolean-parameter-c237a830b7a3)
- Use the correct constructs
- Don't pass null
- [Command Query Separation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html)
- Organize code by the actor it belongs to
- Keep framework code distant
- Tests should be fast, independent, and repeatable
- Refactor often

The gist is to consider all of these small pieces as cogs in the machine.  The consistency and conventions all payoff as the codebase grows.  

Code with empathy, care, craftsmanship, and kaizen.  Write self-documenting code.  Know pattern and principles.  Recognize smells and anti-patterns.

Learn the domain you're coding within.
